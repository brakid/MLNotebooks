# MLNotebooks
Jupyter notebooks of several ML projects

* [Simple visual QA system](https://www.hagen-schupp.me/2020/03/27/SimpleVisualQA.html) - [https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/Simple%20QA.ipynb](https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/Simple%20QA.ipynb)
* Simple 2D Environment for a Race Course - [https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/DrivingSimulator/DrivingEnvironment.ipynb](https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/DrivingSimulator/DrivingEnvironment.ipynb)
* Plant retrieval based on Wikipedia Articles - [https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/Plantdatabase.ipynb](https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/Plantdatabase.ipynb)
* Simple LLM Agent with access to a temperature tool to inform the user about what to wear based on the temperature at their current location - [https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/TemperatureAgent.ipynb](https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/TemperatureAgent.ipynb)
  * Custom LLM agent with a temperature and a heater adjustment tool - [https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/LlamaCustomAgent.ipynb](https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/LlamaCustomAgent.ipynb)
* use a multimodal LLM to play [Lunar Lander](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/): [https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/Lander.ipynb](https://github.com/brakid/MLNotebooks/blob/master/Lander.ipynb)
* [n8n workflow](https://n8n.io) using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) hosted [Qwen3 4B](https://huggingface.co/tensorblock/mlx-community_Qwen3-4B-bf16-GGUF) to take a temperature reading and to recommend clothing fitting for the temperature. The model should avoid using recent recommendations (stored on file) and return the recommendation in a predefined format. The response is sent via a [Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) back to the user: https://n8dex.com/lxlqKG2G
* [n8n workflow](https://n8n.io) using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) hosted [Qwen3 8B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF) to check the status of a predefined dashboard website. It should investigate the reason why the page is down using a sample Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) (e.g docker container running?) and attempt to fix it. It is based on the NetworkChuck Yuutube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=budTmdQfXYU: https://n8dex.com/ZdZq5VKq
